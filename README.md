# README
This is a Node.js application that uses the Onfido API to create an applicant, generate an SDK token, and create a new workflow run Id. The application allows users to input their first name, last name and workflow id, and then initialises the SDK on the page.

5. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the application
